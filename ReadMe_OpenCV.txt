Intel® Open Source Computer Vision Library  

What is OpenCV
OpenCV means Intel® Open Source Computer Vision Library. It is a collection of C functions and a few C++ classes that implement some popular Image Processing and Computer Vision algorithms.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The key features
OpenCV has cross-platform middle-to-high level API that consists of a few hundreds (>300) C functions. It does not rely on external libraries, though it can use some when it is possible.

OpenCV is free for both non-commercial and commercial use (see the license for details).

OpenCV provides transparent interface to Intel® Integrated Performance Primitives (IPP). That is, it loads automatically IPP libraries optimized for specific processor at runtime, if they are available. More information about IPP can be retrieved at http://www.intel.com/software/products/ipp/index.htm

If you have a problem with installing/running/using OpenCV
Read FAQs 
Search through OpenCV archives at www.yahoogroups.com (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OpenCV/) 
Join OpenCV mailing list at yahoo groups (see FAQs on how to do it) and mail your questions (the mailing list will probably migrate to OpenCV's SourceForge site) 
Look at the OpenCV sample code, read the reference manual :)

OpenCV Reference Manuals
CXCORE Reference Manual 
CV Reference Manual 
HighGUI Reference Manual 
CVCAM Reference Manual (RTF) 
You may also look at the PDF manual, but do not trust it much - it is pretty out of date, especially, the reference part.
